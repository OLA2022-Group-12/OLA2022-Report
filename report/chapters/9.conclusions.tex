Even though some of the proposed problems weren't fully solved, most of the results that we found were in with the theoretical guarantees of the literature.
The specifications were at times confusing and misleading, this was a deliberate design choice as it would be closer to a "real life scenario", however this caused several difficulties in the understanding process of the project and was ultimately one of the concurring causes for the deadline delays.

Overall, great effort and time was spent on this project as it revealed itself as a thougher challenge than what we had anticipated, we are mildly satisified with our work as we collectively think that there is still vast room for improvement in several aspects of the project.
