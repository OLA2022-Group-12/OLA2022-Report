## Folders

This repository holds three main folders: **presentation**, **report** and **deliveries**.

While the first two contain respectively the presentation and report files needed to compile both documents, the **deliveries** folder holds the `pdf` artifacts produced and ready for delivery.

## Compilation

In order to compile both the presentation and the report with *latexmk*, the `--shell-escape` and `-pdf` flags are needed.
