\framesubtitle{Assignment}

The focus of this project is to optimize the budget allocated for the \textbf{advertisement campaigns} of 5 different items in order to maximize the profit of an \textit{e-commerce website} that sells products to the public.

Each page has a \textbf{primary product} and some \textbf{secondary products}, each user that lands on a page has a possibility to buy the primary prodcut and/or proceed to one of the secondaries with a given probability, the process repeats.

The optimization has to be perfomed on different scenarios and using different algorithms.

We had to direct our focus on bandit algorithms combining Gaussian Processes with Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling algorithms.

For each different scenario the performance of the learners based on these algorithm is evaluated against the Clayrvoiant and the Stupid Learner.

\frametitle{General hypoteses}

The main general hypoteses that were given to us are:
\begin{itemize}[label={-}]
    \item For every \textit{primary product}, the \textit{secondary products} to display and their order is fixed.
    \item The price of every product is fixed and it is equal to the margin.
    \item By clicking on a specific ad, the user lands on the corresponding \textit{primary product}.
\end{itemize}
